# AppLogin-Exercise - SDET Take-home Challenge

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge Instructions

You'll be writing an end-to-end test for this simple React Native app using Appium.

### âœ… Your Tasks:
1. Write an Appium test that:
   - Launches the app
   - Fills in the correct username/password (`test` / `1234`)
   - Taps the login button
   - Verifies that the Profile screen shows `Welcome, test!`

2. Bonus:
   - Add a negative test: invalid credentials should stay on login and show an error.

3. Answer briefly:
   - How would you scale this test suite to work in CI?
   - Whatâ€™s your strategy to handle flaky Appium tests?
   - How would you structure tests for a large React Native app?
