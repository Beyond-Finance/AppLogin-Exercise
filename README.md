# AppLogin-Exercise - SDET Take-home Challenge

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge Instructions

   - You'll be writing an end-to-end test for this simple React Native app using Appium.
   - Create a spec file for writing both positive and negative scenario.
   - Create a google or word document that has test plan and answers to question 3.
   - Note the time it takes to work on the exercise.
   - Email the spec and doc back to the recruiter.
   - Include a README if setup is needed.

### âœ… Your Tasks:
1. Write an Appium test that:
   - Launches the app
   - Fills in the correct username/password (`test` / `1234`)
   - Taps the login button
   - Verifies that the Profile screen shows `Welcome, test!`

2. Bonus:
   - Add a negative test: invalid credentials should stay on login and show an error.
   - Create a test plan for the Login feature

3. Answer briefly:
   - How would you scale this test suite to work in CI?
   - What other scenarios would you include?
   - Whatâ€™s your strategy to handle flaky Appium tests?
   - How would you structure tests for a large React Native app?
